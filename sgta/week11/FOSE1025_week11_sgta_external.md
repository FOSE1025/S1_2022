# Week 11 SGTA (External Offering)

## Activity 1 - Reproducibility

In the exercises of this activity you will interact with the same system you will use for the reproducibility project. The reproducibility project has two steps and we will recreate them here. **Each step has a separate deadline.**

### 1.1 - Submit a Report (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

Choose a task of your choice and write a set of instructions describing the task. For example, feel free to reuse/improve your submission to the [Achiever hurdle task](https://ilearn.mq.edu.au/mod/turnitintooltwo/view.php?id=6969594). Please submit your own work, do not copy and paste instructions from the Web, so that you have a chance to practice your skills on writing reports for reproducibility.

**Do not submit the reproducibility report associated with your project**

### 1.2 - Peer reviewing (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Use the interface to review at least two reports. In your review, focus on assessing the aspect of reproducibility. In particular, ask yourself this question:

* With the information given in the report, would I be able to reproduce the task?

## Participation Task 1

This week's participation task is the submission of your reviews in Activity 1.2. Submit at least 2 reviews in the workshop activity with name "SGTA Peer Review of Reproducibility".

## Activity 2 - Identify the version of Excel, MATLAB, and your operating system (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

The following links can help you identify this information.

* Version of Excel Online: I could not find information about how to identify the version of Excel Online, so you can just say that the version is, well, Excel Online.
* [Version of MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/version.html)
* Version of your Operating System
  * [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)

## Activity 3 - Hypothetical ethics case study (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Below is a hypothetical case. Read the case and answer the questions below. In your answers, do not just say "yes" or "no". Also, justify the answer.

> You need to determine the attitudes of Australians with respect to the use of online learning tools. Since you do not have much time you decide to gather a collection of tweet posts made available by Twitter and use it for your research. This collection is public, anybody can use it, but it is a small portion of all tweets posted by people worldwide. Twitter allows people to store the tweets collected for personal use but forbids them to distribute the tweets to other people.

1. If we stored the tweets in our local computers, would there be any issues related to privacy or security?
2. If we stored the tweets in the cloud, would there be any issues related to privacy or security?
3. This scenario has issues regarding fairness. Discuss the nature of these issues.
4. Are there any issues related to disclosure?

## Participation task 2

Submit your answers to activity 3 in the Week 11 SGTA participation task submission box.
